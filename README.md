# Password Generator Assignment

## This assignment consisted of creating a random password generator, I found this one to be pretty difficult for my considering I have no history of JavaScript. Through research online and what I have learned in class; with the help from the TAs and the online Tutor I was able to get this password generator to work how it should. Althrough JavaScript can be discouraging and frustrating at times for someone with no experience in it I feel like I am learning and progressing at a decent pace.
